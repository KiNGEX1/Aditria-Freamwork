## Overview

This tool is designed for conducting wireless network penetration testing and includes several powerful attack features to assess network security.

## Features

- **Capture WEP Packets**: Intercept and analyze packets on WEP-encrypted networks.
- **WPA Handshake Capture**: Sniff and capture WPA handshake packets for offline analysis and decryption.
- **WPA/WPA2 Key Cracking**: Utilize wordlists to attempt passphrase cracking of captured WPA/WPA2 handshakes.
- **Beacon Flood Attack**: Overwhelm target networks with beacon frames to cause network instability.
- **ARP Cache Poisoning**: Redirect network traffic and intercept data by poisoning the ARP cache of connected devices.
- **Reveal Hidden SSID**: Discover hidden SSIDs by forcing APs to broadcast their network names.
